# This is a Rails app and we want to load all the files in the app 
# when running this code.  To do so, your current working directory
# should be the top-level directory (i.e. /workspace/your-app/) and then run:
# rails runner labs/3-migrations.rb

# **************************
# Don't change or move
Activity.destroy_all

# Add new Activity model with database table

# 1. in terminal, run:
# rails generate model Activity

# 2. open newly generated files

# 3. add relevant columns to the db/migrate file

# 4. execute the migration file. in terminal, run:
# rails db:migrate

# Activity is the join model between Salesperson and Contact
# Add the relevant associations to the models.

# 5. Insert at least 2 activities into the activities table
